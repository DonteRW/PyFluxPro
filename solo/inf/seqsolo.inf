Line 1: No. of nodes - default is the number of drivers plus 1 (changeable via GUI if used)
Line 2: NdaFactor - not used by SEQSOLO, default value is 0
Line 3: learning rate - default value 0.01 (must be between 0.0 1nd 1.0, changeable via GUI if used)
Line 4: number of iterations for sequential training, default value is 500 (changeable via GUI if used)
Line 5: fourth output file from SOFM, used as input file by SEQSOLO
Line 6: input data filename with path relative to current directory
Line 7: type of run ("training" or "simulation", always "simulation" for SEQSOLO)
Line 8: seed for random number generator - default is 9100
